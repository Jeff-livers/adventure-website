I’ve been thinking about making a website to showcase my adventures for quite some time now. After completing the PCT, I found that creating this website would be a fantastic way to share my experience with others, as well as help memorialize it for myself. All the while, I am learning valuable skills on the web development process, as well as the technical know-how to actually accomplish it. 

I found that I learned so much on the PCT. Every day I came to learn something new about myself, about the areas I was hiking through, or about my frineds. It was beautiful to have an experience where I was able to engege with my thoughts for such a continuous period of time. As a result, I have a lot of ideas! I think many of them are very great and if they’ve helped me, then they can help others as well. I have so much content and ideas that I want to show people. Even if hardly anyone sees what I have, i'll be glad to know that I have a wonderful resource that I put together on my own accord.
