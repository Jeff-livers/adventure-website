# Writing For Backpacking Website

Structure / who inspired

after reading the book ultralight backpackin tips by mike mclellen, I began to really embrace the philosophy of ultralight, not only throught the choices of gear, but through the baseline philopsophy behind those choices. IN one of jupiters videos, there was a guy who said that ultralight is like wearing a pair of wings. On this tiny little pack on your back carries everything you will need to comfortably travel in the wilderness for days at a time. It is truly beautiful to embrace the feeling of freedom that backpacking gives you. In this website I want to inspire people through my stories that i’ve had through my adventures, as well as guide them for how to get started. I have a lot of philosophy intertwined and I think that is important to noe as well. I belivee that there is a lack of solid unified infromation for “how to get into backpacking”. The only way that I’ve come to the gear and knowledge that I have now, is through years and years of browsing reddit threads, youtube videos, books, other people, guides, and most of all, experience. I want to create a source where people can go and find depth. I don’t think that I have all the knowledge needed to call myself an expert in the field of backpacking, but I sure do know quite a bit and I know where the good rescources are.
