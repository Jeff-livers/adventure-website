# Real Life vs. Online

  
## Overall structure

* - trail was awesome because I felt like I could form my own thoughts
* the power of online narratives
* personal example with many trail opinions
* * this has led me to become aware of this feeling that things are not the way they seem online
* online is overblown and makes it seem like that is the way things are in reality
* that can make you feel so bad and stuck and scared
* Counter argument that some poeple would say it is necessary and important to be aware of problems presented onine
* I would say this is true to a degree but it is so important to have restraint and awareness (youtube hit pause) 
* the importance of cirtical thinking
* the importance of just getting out there and seeing for yourself. 

I hiked the pct in 2023, californias largest snow year in recorded history, by a significant margin. Before I started I would search and search for morsels of information, ways to prepare, peoples experiences, and peoples predicitons, and everything and anything to make myself feel better. I think some of this had its benefit. Through my research I decided I was gonna flip flop before I even started. I knew through this research that with snow, came a lot of variability and trouble. I was confident in my decision to flip past the snow, regarldess of weather it melts in time or not. 

Before I started I researched and researched and looked and looked for peoples experiences, advice, gear, lessons, etc. Once I actually started hiking, I came to realize how much of that really did not matter. The biggest thing was just my ability to keep going. 

i’m writing this because i’ve become aware of the feeling. This feeling that things are not always the way they seem. And truly the only way for you to see how it is, is to see for yourself. Every persons individual experience aries wildly due to their previous experience, confidence, gear, risk tolerance, etc. I heard people speak of the sierras this year as the craziest most harrowing thing of their life, and other people write it off as a challenge they felt confident in. I heard talk about the snow on san jacinto as terrifying and reccoemnding an ice axe, to a complete non-issue that didn’t even warrant the use of micro spikes. some people can cruise through a heatwave with no more than some extra water and extra breaks, whereas another person may see the upcoming forecast and decide to stay ride it out in a hotel room in town. The thing about all of this, is that every person is right. Every person that talks about their experience with it is correct for how they processed the risk of the experience in relation to their risk tolerance and previous experiences. As I write this, it is heavily raning outside despite a 0% chance of precipitation for the entire day. 

One of the most beautiful things about trail is how little influence there is. And beyond that, at a certain point I begin to feel so confident in myself, my judgement, and my capabilities that I felt good making decisions that were best for me. I felt like I had room to breathe and space to think. One of the hardest things about being back, is being surrounded by otherpeople opinions and ideas. Billboards, instagram, instruction manuals, posters, text messages, emails. Everything is trying to communicate some thing in some form. 

There is a huge discrepancy from online perceptions, and the real lived experience. I think it’s something that is being talked about and people are generally aware, but I think its hard to understand just how pervasive it is until you do something ike a thru-hike where you are fully independent. 

Today I read a front page reddit post that asked “Are millenials not letting their kids have sleepovers anymore?”. A valid question on its own and I’m sure there is verifiable evidence that there has been a general decline in the rate of sleepovers over time. I was expecting answers such as “kids are on their phones so much that they don’t engage in in person activities as much” but instead, almost every single top comment was about the prvelance of sexual abuse at sleepovers, followed by peoples personal experience to back it up. I’m sure that there is an issue with sexual abuse at sleepovers, and I am not discrediting the people who shared their stories, but I think it is so easy to passivley pass through a reddit thread like this and now have your internal opinion be slightly altered without even realizing it. It is so easy to read it and just accept “huh yeah I guess letting my child sleepover at their friends house = getting sexualy abused” without putting any critical thought behind it. There was another reddit post about the trend of gas prices through time adjusted for inflation, and it showed and massive spike in 2022 and 2023, substantially above any other time period. I ooked at the comments and most of them were just tearing apart the factual accuracy of this “guide” citing that most of the information was wrong and displayed in a way to draw out fear and sensationalism. sensationalism sells.
